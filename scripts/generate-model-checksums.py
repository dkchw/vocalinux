"""Regenerate src/vocalinux/utils/model_checksums.txt from upstream metadata.

Vocalinux downloads 40MB-2GB speech models at install time and on first run,
then hands them to native code (whisper.cpp loads its ggml files through
``ctypes.cdll``). Nothing about that is safe unless we know what we received,
so every downloader checks the file against a hash pinned *in this repository*
rather than one fetched alongside the download.

Where that hash comes from differs by registry, and so does what generating it
costs:

* whisper.cpp ships on Hugging Face, whose API exposes the sha256 of every LFS
  blob (``lfs.oid``) plus the commit the listing was taken at, so nothing is
  downloaded for it. That commit is pinned too -- the download URLs use it
  instead of ``main``, so upstream retagging a file cannot turn every user's
  install into a checksum failure.
* VOSK is different: ``model-list.json`` carries an md5 per model, but that is a
  metadata field from the same host we are pinning against, so copying it pins
  nothing an attacker could not change alongside the file. Those models are
  downloaded here and pinned by the sha256 of the bytes we actually received;
  the published md5 is checked against them on the way through, so a listing
  that disagrees with its own file is caught at generation time. Downloading is
  incremental -- a model already pinned by sha256 is not fetched again, so only
  new models cost bandwidth. A first run, or any run with --refresh, therefore
  pulls every VOSK zip: ~21.9GB, roughly half an hour on a fast connection.

The model names come from the package itself, so a model added to
vosk_model_info.py, whispercpp_model_info.py, parakeet_model_info.py or
faster_whisper_model_info.py is picked up on the next run and a model that
upstream never published fails the generation loudly.

Usage:  just model-checksums   (or: python scripts/generate-model-checksums.py)
